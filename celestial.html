  Celestials are humanoid creatures that have been around for millions of years, 
  an exact date for their creation has never been found. They live in <b>pocket dimensions</b> inaccessible
  to humans and have influenced the development and evolution of the species. Many religions have some 
  mentions of Celestials, like the ideas of <b>Gods or Angels and Demons</b> as well as the concept of 
  <b>Heaven and *****.</b>
  <br><br>
  Celestials have adapted over time to live in a more modern human society, using their <b>magic</b> to alter 
  their appearances and look like humans and even using the names ‘Angels and Demons’ as an easier way to 
  describe themselves. They tend to keep to themselves and are wary around humans (also known as mortals). 
  This is mainly due to the fact that when they have revealed themselves throughout history it has ended in 
  <b>wars and events such as witch trials</b>.
  <br><br>
  The two main Celestial species (the ones dubbed as <b>Angels and Demons</b>) have opposing magic. 
  Angels can manipulate and create <b>light</b> while Demons can do the same to <b>shadows</b>. Both can create a 
  solid version of these. Some Celestials can also create elements known as <b>“Heaven’s Acid”</b> and <b>“*****’s 
  Flame”</b> more commonly spoken of as <b>“Holy Water”</b> and <b>“***** Fire”</b>.
